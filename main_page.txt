/*! \mainpage Lightys

 *  

 *  \section Introduction

 *  Lightys is a C++ library for the ws2812b led strip, created to be used on the Arduino due.

 *  

 *  \section Hardware

 *  Lightys has been created and tested on an Arduino due. It might work on other devices but this has not been tested.

 *    

 *  \section Limitations

 *  Since the Arduino due has no heap the limit on the amount of leds cannot be dynamic and has to be a static limit.

 * The current limit is 1000 leds. This should be enough for anyone using this library, but can be changed if necessary.

 *  

 *  \section Usage

 *  Include Lightys.hpp in your program and add both Lightys.hpp and Lightys.cpp to your Makefile.

 * The library is dependant on hwlib for several functions, so make sure you have that installed that as well.
